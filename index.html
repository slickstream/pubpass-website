        <p>Advertising pays the bills for many websites you visit today. We enable a better choice for consumers and
          publishers:
          <span class="highlight">microsubscriptions</span>. Subscribers get a better experience. Publishers get more
          revenue.
        </p>
        <p>Until now, this has been
          impractical for three
          reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>Transaction costs are too high;</li>
          <li>The sign-up process is a hassle; and</li>
          <li>Adding a subscription system is complex.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We solve these problems.</p>

      <section class="bodySection">
        <h2>For Consumers</h2>
        <p>When you visit a website that offers a microsubscription you want, click on the "Purchase using PubPass"
          button.
          You will be redirected to PubPass to confirm your purchase. If you already have a PubPass, this takes just one
          click
          and you'll return to that site with your new subscription (or renewal) already live.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't yet have a PubPass, it's easy. Sign in to create a pass, and then recharge it using your credit
          card. PubPass is like some transit cards. When you make
          a purchase, we deduct the amount from your pass. You can recharge your pass anytime you want in any amount you
          want.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can come to PubPass anytime and see a complete list of all of your subscriptions -- including when they
          expire and even set them to auto-renew if you like.
        </p>
        <p>More and more sites are starting to offer PubPass microsubscriptions. With only a click and a few cents per
          month, you'll be supporting your favorite sites and getting a better experience -- all with a single click.

        <h2>For Publishers</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to start offering microsubscriptions, it's easy. Sign up at PubPass and tell us
          about your site. We'll give you a simple embed code to add to your pages. You choose what subscription
          pricing you want to offer, and which benefits to offer subscribers, such as an ad-free experience, exclusive
          content, e-books, personalized newsletters, and more. You also decide how and where you will ask viewers to
          purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do all the rest. Our embed code takes care of presenting the widgets to your viewers where you want
          them and when appropriate. We recognize the subscribers and change their experience dynamically based on the
          features
          you chose to offer. For example, depending on what you've selected, we'll hide any ads,
          make special content accessible, and remove any paywalls on protected content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can integrate into your email contact system so that you will have a complete list of your
          subscribers.
          We support integrations into the most popular email systems including MailChimp, ConvertKit, and others.
        </p>
        <p>You can visit PubPass anytime to see how your subscriptions are doing. We'll send you a monthly summary
          report. And we'll send you a check monthly with your earnings or will deposit them directly into your bank
          account.
